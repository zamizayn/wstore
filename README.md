# WStore - Multi-tenant WhatsApp Commerce Platform

WStore is a robust, production-ready commerce platform designed to enable businesses to sell products directly through WhatsApp. It features a sophisticated multi-tenant architecture, allowing super-admins to manage multiple merchants (tenants), each with their own branches, products, and sales logs.

## 🚀 Overview

WStore bridges the gap between traditional e-commerce and conversational commerce. By leveraging the WhatsApp Business API, it allows customers to browse products and place orders within their favorite messaging app, while providing merchants with a powerful React-based admin dashboard to manage their operations.

## 📂 Project Structure

The project is organized as a monorepo-style structure containing both the backend API and the administrative frontend:
